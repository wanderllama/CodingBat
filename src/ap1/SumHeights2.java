/*(A variation on the sumHeights problem.) We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the sum of the changes for a walk beginning at the start index and ending at the end index, however increases in height count double. For example, with the heights {5, 3, 6, 7, 2} and start=2, end=4 yields a sum of 1*2 + 5 = 7. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.*/
